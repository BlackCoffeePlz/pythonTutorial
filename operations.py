"""
In most programming languages, operators are used to perform operations on variables
and values. Python divides operators into the following groups:
"""

"""
Arthmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations

    +       Addition            x + y
    -       Substraction        x - y
    *       Mutliplication      x * y
    /       Division            x / y
    %       Modulus             x % y
    **      Exponentiation      x ** y
    //      Floor Division      x // y

**Tip**
The addition operator can be used to concatenate or join strings.
print("Hello" + "World") <---- will return "HelloWorld"

Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values. When used, the statement will return 
a boolean value.

    ==          Equal                       x == y
    !=          Not Equal                   x != y
    >           Greater Than                x > y
    <           Less Than                   x < y
    >=          Greater than or equal to    x >= y
    **          Less than or equal to       x <= y


Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to conditional statements

    and     Returns True if both statements are true        x < 5 and x < 10
    or      Returns True if one statement is true           x < 5 or x < 4
    not     Reverse the result                              not(x < 5 and x <10)


Identity Operators
Identity operators are used to compare object themselves rather than their value.

    is          Returns True if both values are the same object     x is y
    is not      Returns True if both values are not the saem        x is not y
