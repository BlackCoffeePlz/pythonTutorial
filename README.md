# Python Tutorial

Quick start tutorial for learning python programming.


Python is a high-level interpreted language. An interpreted language is a programming language in which the source
code is directly executed by an interpreter without the need for compilation.

In an interpreted language, the source code (the code you write), is executed one line at a time. The interpreter
reads each line of code, interprets it, and executes it before moving on to the next line of code.

This is in contrast to compiled languages, where the source code is compiled into machine code before it can be
executed at all once. Compiled languages include Java, C++, and Rust.

Some popular interpreted languages include Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP. These interpreted languages are often
used for scripting, web development, and other tasks where fast development cycles and ease of use are important.

One advantage of interpreted languages is that they are typically easier to learn and write code in, as there is no
need to set up a complex development environment to compile the code. Additionally, interpreted languages are often
more platform-independent than compiled languages, as the interpreter can run on various platforms without having to
recompile the code.

However, interpreted languages are generally slower than compiled languages, since the code is not optimized during
the compilation process. Additionally, interpreted languages can have a higher memory overhead, as the interpreter
needs to be loaded into memory along with the source code.
