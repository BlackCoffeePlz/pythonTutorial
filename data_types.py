# String(str)
# Strings, sometimes abbreviated with str, are literal text, that are referenced with either quotes '', double quotes "", or triple quotes/double quotes
# Example:
'Hello World'

"I am also a string"


# Before we proceed further, lets introduce ourselves to variables. Variables are assignments,
# which act as reference to data. These variables can be named anything, but in python,
# variables_are_written_in_snake_case. Variables are case sensitive.
#
# Example:
var = "I am a string"
variable_in_action = 'I am also a string'

# At any time, We can observe the value of our data with a built-in python function called print.
# Example:
print("I just got printed")
print(variable_in_action)


# When we construct variables, we can also give a hint to what class, or data type
# the variable is.
# Example:
empty_string: str = ""

# Hinting your variables are completely optional, but is commonly seen with python3 style of writing.

# Integer(int)
# Integers are whole numbers that can be used for counting and advanced calculations.
# Example:

small_number: int = 5
big_number = 500

# Float(float)
# Floats are decimal point numbers, and like integers, they are also used for counting and advanced calucations
# Example

my_birthday: float = 4.24
your_birthday = 12.22


# Boolean(bool)
# Booleans are True/False, useful in constructing logic.
# Example

is_tired: bool = False
random_boolean = True
